Deprecated free software license added to license list

<![CDATA[
<p>We recently updated our list of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">various licenses and comments about them</a> to include the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#HPND">Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer</a>(HPND). The HPND is a simple permissive license, compatible with all versions of the GPL. The HPND is actually more of a template, allowing developers to select a few options, such as whether to include a disclaimer. Variations on this license had actually been approved previously (such as the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#Python1.6a2">old license of Python</a>), but it never had its own entry in the list. While at this point HPND is largely deprecated in favor of more modern lax licenses, you can still find it on some current projects, and kicking around inside some long-running projects that include code created back when it was more prevalent. As such, we wanted to include it on the list explicitly, to help clear up any confusion regarding whether this simple license was free software. </p>

<p>In this edition, we conducted an email-based interview with <a href="https://fmarier.org">François Marier</a>, a free software developer from New Zealand. He is the lead developer of <a href="https://www.libravatar.org">Libravatar</a>. In addition to his passion for decentralization, he contributes to the Debian project and volunteers on the FSF licensing team.</p> <p>Libravatar is a free network service providing profile photos for a number of Web sites, including <a href="https://bugs.debian.org">bugs.debian.org</a> and <a href="https://git.kernel.org">git.kernel.org</a>. Its flexible <a href="https://wiki.libravatar.org/description/">architecture</a> allows end users to host their own images and allows Web sites to use Gravatar as a fallback when necessary. It is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3, or end user can opt for any later version (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU AGPLv3+</a>).</p> <h2>What inspired you to create Libravatar?</h2> <p>As I explained in a <a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2011/2011-01-26-Wednesday/N515/Freeing_the_Cloud_one_service_at_a_time.
